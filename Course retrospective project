<p>Having Christine Daniel WRA110 class is a good choice, it worth and will help you to in your future study and career, because people have to do some kinds of high technique project to attract the customer and audience, such as created a HTML website, blog and edit the video. These are skills which we have to own if we want hold any company of institute. Take my dream as a case, I want be an owner of a restaurant, if I want to run my business well at the beginning, I have to do something about media press and do appropriate promotion to the people around me, in other words, if my company is small scale at first, I have to do everything on my own by saving those spending.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the semester, we have wrote about lived experience as a self -introduction and narrative about our major, the reason why we write this is that teacher want us get a warm up and get know our writing level and let students know each other at first. Secondly, we wrote about cultural analysis paper which can point some controversial topic in the world, as a new generation about the world, we have to focus on the news which occur about our normal life. For study further, we did research about our major which related with the technology. I learned so many new technology which related with my major, it helped my no matter for my writing class or explore my major. At first, I felt confuse and helpless about the requirement and I felt there is nothing that I need to write about, because my major is hospitality business, it is a kind of serving industry, there is no relationship with technology, but I found a kind of high technology which invented in this field after research, that make me passionate about the new technology about my field and made me what to research more and getting more academic knowledge. And then, we put everything we wrote and some in class activities contents in the blog, that was the new thing I ever learned, because just can viewed others blog and feel envy about writing a single blog or column before. To get more professional, Professor Daniel let us use code academy to learn how to build a website, and it is a kind of professional to know how to build a website, the guidance resource which she gave us the specific method about what we can do and built a well HTML.
And at the end of the semester, we also did a review about our all writing, because we need to know what we have learned and do reflection about this semester, people get progress if they know where is right and where is wrong for their past paper and report.
</p>
<p>Turning to the vision about my writing method and skill, we have done four research papers this semester for WRA 110 class, they all about writing something which related with technology, living experience, cultural analysis proposal, and formal research paper and remix project. These contents all written about my major field by us, I found some experiences which can help us writing paper successfully, even though words is easy to type, but how to make it qualified and accurate is a huge task.</p>
<p>People usually feel terrified about hearing the assignment is writing a paper, we have to know the purpose about writing, everyone have their favorite thing to learn and to do, I like hospitality business, there is no doubt that I have to write something professional about the term paper in the major class, but we have to be professional and aimed. Writing progress is pretty important for every students.</p>
<p>First, we have to know what the purpose for writing the paper, is there anything we want to express specifically? Read the requirement carefully about the class syllabus and understand what professor need you to do, people do not want waste time and write something which has no connection with the assignment topic, I had experienced once that I wrote something which is not fit with the topic, it was a kind of waste for you too. As an international student, we need to keep the main point in the mind, we cannot writing content without targeting. So I suggest that people communicate with classmates in order to make sure you are on the right track, at the same time, you will get more ideas through communication. The third step is brainstorming the idea for what you are going to write, measure how much resources can be find easily, resources are mostly come from internet and book, it is tough to find supporting evidences from book because you have to read so many contents and pick small part of evidence, but you will learn so many things through research and picking job. After research, you can Write a brief outline and make reservation with Writing Center, they will enrich your idea and lead you have a well organization, idea and structure. Well organization is really important for reader to understand you meaning and clear the main points. Getting further research for the essay, search information online by supporting your point, go to the library, and ask for help from staff if you need assist. Here is the website in university official library website, there are different library around campus base on different major, mind is allowed in business library. So if you want to find the book resource in library, you have to go to the business library and look up the website, and then go to ProQuest, find the book and resources. It is easy to write draft if you did enough research and well organization because everything you want to write were kept in your mind, the only thing we can do it type it out within the right limited words and enough reference to support your idea. After you hand in the first draft, peer review is really useful because your classmates can give you so many fresh idea, help check the grammar and tell you what they want to know more if they are the audience,	If we miss out way, we can find help from the ESL or Writing center for correcting your grammar mistake.  And then, correct it after you got the opinion from your academic professor.
Compare with my original writing skill, it has improved tremendously, because I found a way to write paper with well organization and structure, and I learnt some literacy example in English, poem and some documentary class activity is the class I never had before, it helped me to understand English deeply so that I can write paper creatively. In addition, we did two group projects, one is remix projects, it was really fun because we need to work together and gather good ideas together and make it in the best way, first we thought about make some poster, we changed mind because it may not effective enough, video could be the best way to express our opinion, after we decide doing video, we started to worry about in what way we can show our idea in the video, and then we decide interview could be best for our project, during the group work, we learnt how to negotiate and something about technical skill by making a good video.
</p>
<p>After that Remix project, we did the last final formal research project. This project is much easier than the last one, the reason why it is easier than the last one is that we learnt how to communicate with team member and make the group project efficiency and better.</p>
<p>In conclusion, people will not regret if they take WRA 110 Professor Danielâ€™s class, because it is a good opportunity to learn something advanced which related with technology and get reflection after finish the work, website design and blog editing are the most unique part for WRA110. It will help you a lot in future career and let you be outstanding among everyone. Besides that, I made some good classmates on the class, they have been helped me and showed their creativity on the class, their intelligent and creativity let me envy and open. It is true that western country people are creative and open minded, maybe we have different life environment since we are young, so what we are thinking is totally different, and it was interesting that cultural difference let me learn so many things about life and thought, maybe they feel the same way. However hope you will feel this amazing fact, take your positive attitude to learn more things which include knowledge in the class and real life.
