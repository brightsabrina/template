<p>Entry #1-First class</p>
		<p>I am exciting for meeting all my new classmates for WRA 110, as an international student, I felt nervouse when I talk to American in English,it caused that  I missed so many oppotunity to express my thought.So I decide to be brave and as something I do not know , because it worth to ask something that I do not know for class and knowledge.And I realized that language is just a kind of tool,it can not be a barrier between human,people from different country have different racial, but we need to find something interesting from different cultural.I believe good people are around me in my life for helping if I have positive attitude.</p>
<p>Entry #2-Poem Video</p>
<p>After watched this video, I felt it is too much for a normal people by understand. But I can see the purpose of this video is that they want the support from everyone about homosexual issue, because he gave audience a hind about his background at the beginning of the video, after offering his background, he started to show his poem to everyone with a strongest emotion which came from his inside. It was memorable and moved. Everyone who have the right to love the people they love, there has no limitation about gender, because they all equal good person in the world.
This poem is good, but I personally like read it in the article format, and I cannot write it in this way either. Maybe I can write something about my life and make the story fun and profession for lived experience paper.
</p>
<p>Today, I am confused about what we need to do about this class except writing paper, I realized we have so many things to do except writing assignment, I tried to figure that out, and then I start to ask classmates, but it was explained by English, there was still a understanding gap by knowing what is the class purpose, so I talked to my classmates and see what they are doing, in addition, I also asked somebody who from the same country with me. Finally, I understood and I know we have to do so many staff about this class which is really complicated.</p>
<p>Entry #3-Balance my busy semester</p>
<p>I came class late, because I cannot wake up in the morning, this is the most busy semester I ever had, I have an internship job in Everyday Chinese Restaurant, it was fun but tired. Isn’t too much have over 20 hours work for a student who take 18 credits per week. But I love my job and passionate by satisfying each of my customer. And it is good to cumulate some experience from the real life except class, service management is also one course I am taking this semester, I believe combine theory and real practice can make my job more and more professional. The only thing I need to do is balance my job and my study. Keep balance and get a good GPA.</p>
<p>Entry #4-Sad day</p>
<p>Serving guest in the restaurant should be an enjoyable staff, because I can introduce my favorite food to my customer and made them satisfy. But I am too emotional those day, I feel that I did not cherish my first 2 years in MSU. In this 2 years, I learn English and I feel like I did nothing, I worked out a lot, such as gym and yoga, at the same time, I was on diet, but the result is that I did not lose any weight. I did not play hard, now I see some of the restaurant guests are freshman, they always talk their travel plan and participate some fun club, such as some club which related with their major, and they also can hang out with their favorite friends. Compare with them, I cannot even eat with my roommates for weekends’ breakfast because I have to work. On the other hand, I have to cheer up, because I can learn so many things while they are playing and I also have colleagues with me, it is a kind for comfort.</p.
<p>Entry #5-codeacademy</p>
<p>Learning how to code a website is great, while I learn how to code a website, build a website for the restaurant where I work is wonderful. Because more people will know it and come if there is a website for the delicious and exotic food. And I also would like to introduce our traditional cultural to the reader and make their life fun. At the same time we could get a good business.</p>
<p>Entry #6- recognition problem abour codeacademy website</p>
<p>Codeacademy website make me angry because I followed instruction step by step,but it could not go trough,after I took a rest and sign in by others computer, it could go trough by doing same method.In some extend, we could say computer like human because they need rest.For the content we need to do for code academy, it like CSE class which we have take before.</p>
<p>Entry #7-Social network</p>
<p>We all watched that movie on the class, it talk about story related with facebook, so intelligence college student did heck staff in Howard social network, and they act like adults. I used facebook not quaite oftern because I have one in Chinese version which called Renren,nowadays,Renren became a popular shares in China and the world's stock market.People like share their favourite meal and fashionable outfit on the social website.Some people like it, but some are jelouse and they start to compare each other.</p>
<p>Entry #8-Continue Social Network reflection</p>
<p>In the movie, we found that the smart guy in campus is most wired and brilliant one, education does not mean anything, they just have this talent naturally, they are ambitious, so people admire him by the good technology. They invent something new by increasing economics, it is beneficial for their personal success if they do it well.</p>
<p>Entry #9-New Chinese Restaurant</p>
<p>One new Chinese restaurant opened today, they cook the similar food with the restaurant where I work, my boss feel nervous, and we got less people this week. But in my opinion, I think people will go try something new, but the taste of our dishes which means secret recipe and my passionate service cannot be instead. And then, chef start to invent some new dishes on the menu, it make me realized that people like to try something new even they come frequent, one day, they feel bored, so invent new dishes or make something fresh about restaurant should be the thing we have to do in a certain period. And then, we can keep the returning customer and attract new customer.</p>
<p>Entry #10-Documetary about human's life</p>
<p>In the documentray video, I found the mystery about human being.They introduced the new technology we had nowadays, and then they started to research about ancient aliens base on different cultural and analyzed in different field, and then anthropologies explained who or what we really are.</p>
<p>Entry #11-By reviewing the documentary video</p>
<p>By reviewing the documentary video,People transferred by the artificially genetic changed which arranged by god, human being were look like bird , but ancient aliens still have the ability to heal themselves when they got diseases, and those skills were heritage by us, they surgery we did in the hospital by the technology are from ancient period.</p>
<p>Entry #12-Formal research paper</p>
<p>At this paper due time,I have similar academic paper due also about my major topic.For this one, we have to talk about some technology which related with my major, for another one,I have to talk about something abour restarurant design. How we make the restaurant better is the one I want to mentioned,so professor let us make a report about what our suggestion for the restaurant.For technology, I researched that we lived in a high technology society, people start to use electronic device to finish every action about Hospitality business, even though service is related with service.</p>

<p>Entry #14-Commercial video for Detriot</p>
