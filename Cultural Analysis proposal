		<p>Vanity is a common psychological condition of humans, regardless of gender, age, and profession. It is a natural behavior in which people care more about their image than anything else. Some people just keep the thought to themselves, however some are not good at hiding it. They expose their emotions (what they’re jealous of and discrimination) by owning material things. Maybe they feel tired of showing their best to everyone, but they still need to do it to satisfy their vanity. Vanity is related to self-respect. The weaker and more insecure the people, the more they care about their self- image. Vanity can be showed in so many aspects, such as appearance, knowledge, fortune and social status. These things has made the society become more and more cruel.</p>
<p>In some respect, people should care they self-image, but not so extremely, If they care more about this, other aspect of their will be affected. When people get a rid of old things and buy new fashionable one, it is a kind of waste and not environmentally friendly. There is a video describing how humans treat those materials which lead the people become more fashion for keeping up with the times .That video made by Annie Leonard talks about “The story of stuff.” It shows the connection between a huge number of environmental and social issues; it makes me think that we need to create a sustainable world. The most impressive thing she mentioned in the video is about fashion changing so fast, clothes must be sifted out frequently. People like to compare themselves with others and like to stay updated by watching advertisements. “Fashionistas” do not accept out of style and times, and they just keep buying more things by keeping themselves fashion and following the main stream. The reason why they could sacrifice their money for buying those exterior materials because they attention the image too much and they do not want be scorn by anybody, those comes from the vanity. For keeping people vanity and confidence, we need to keep the society sustainability and more positive.</p>
<p>However, this is over consumption of fashion, it is not only happened on adults but also happened on kids and students, take wearing school uniform as an example, school want to educate kid to save money, but they still want to buy new cloth and they be unique. School require students wear uniform for not letting students have some kinds of discrimination, but some students do not comply with the rule, they wear their own clothes and compare the brand of clothes and shoes, this is not the right way to educate and cultivate them while they growing up. Conversely, some people think we cannot improve the economy by not updating frequently, but have you realized the most popular style for everything are old fashion nowadays. Therefore, world developed cyclical, it is a common knowledge that the earth is round, creativity is good but finally human will walk to the beginning. All comparison happened because their vanity.</p>
<p>Speaking on the knowledge vanity effect, it could be positive and negative. Some people feel honorable because they are knowledgeable, but some just feel not comfortable by seeing people bagged and discriminate them. Therefore, negative is more serious than positive. Especially for children, Regard children as a piece of white paper, parents are painters, children will be raise by what parents paint. We all know that western country advocate encouragement education, but Asian education is totally different, school and parents require kids learn so many things, which made negative effects on them. By saving the good reputation, kid have to follow parents’ arrangement, such as having musical class, going to the Olympic Mathematic class training and show everything when parents ask them to do, it cause them have no time to rest and think independently. It could beneficial for them because they will be outstanding in future and feel pleasure when people prize them, but they always get confuse about what they want and suffering wronged. These experiences they had cannot be erase because they got a bad childhood. So appropriate education guide kids to the right way and let them choose independently, but not being a tool of flaunt, that could affect kids tremendously. Knowledge could improve individual on spirit but not satisfy vanity, otherwise, there is nothing beneficial for people to learn. The reason why they trying that hard to be outstanding among everyone，because they want win things which others cannot achieve or cannot determine, they enjoy their difference and same on the material aspects.</p>
<p>In our life, people would like to chase more luxury life when they have a strong establishment for their basic life, purchasing more luxurious goods could make them satisfy about their life and feel fulfillment when others people saw the luxury goods they wear.</p>
<p>Luxury goods could be the most fortune that adults and family could compare. Many manufacture produce the fake products, such as luxurious items and some rare accessories, such as jade, pearl and gold. People chasing the better life by purchasing those luxury goods. Nowadays, people could buy luxurious goods, and people could recognize them. No matter how old is the people. Man care car so much, they envy the people who drive fancy car, kids flaunt the family car with their friends, even elder people can recognize. People always look down by the dressing, especially in the store, some sales express their emotion very clear, they like serve the people who look rich. However, it is hard to tell who is rich or not by dressing. And some people wearing the fake jewelry to achieve others trust, think it in another way, people just superficial, they just have strong vanity. </p>
<p>Take a good example, Bill Gates, CEO of Microsoft Company, he is an inventor, investor and manager for Microsoft Company. Now he is on the list of world wealthiest people, but he treat his kids fairly and not exaggerated [1].As a daughter of a billionaire, Jennifer Gates, she never wear luxury bag and clothes, she do not drive any fancy car, she dress simple, never show off what she have and her temperament and welled cultured.</p>
<p>It is a market for business, so many people wearing it by showing their status and fortune to the society. Some people who have rich family wearing luxury thing by showing their social status, but actually it is really hard for them to buy it, vanity promote them to do this, they cares a lot about the material thing, even that it does not match them and their age and social status. Junior purchasing the luxurious good increasingly, some of them cost more than 1,000 dollars buying cloth and shoes, the only place they go is school, they do not have any business to worry, in some extent, and these material things are not match with their social status, the only purpose that is they want use their best and wealthy family to attract more people.</p>
<p>Knowledge, integrity and moral people have are people’s fortune, this cannot erase and stole by others, those material fortune which you cannot take when you leave the world, but your good spirit will be always around you friends and people.</p>
<p>The reason why people could get valuable fortune that is because people has a steady and high level social status. People are fighting for their social status all the time, they feel satisfy when they get respected and envy by others. On the other hand, people who compliment them have the purpose which is satisfy their vanity, they want raise they social status and they feel powerful by knowing people who live in high class of the society. There is no doubt that people will be really proud by knowing the chairman of their own country and some celebrities, everybody know that is interesting, and want to get close relationship with them and seek the benefit for meeting them. And then some people got better social status, and some kept brag to others. It is not only happened for adults but also impact kids. In my experience, kids like make the ranking list on the class depends on the family background, such as kid could be a class leader who have the tough family background by having a father who work in the government. In another case, kids could be really proud of themselves because of wealthy family, we can see this controversial topic from the society and media, just like we see on the television, drama gossip girl is an obvious one which can expose the society, kids were raised under a wealthy family, they never stop chasing the upper east life, they may feel empty, but vanity and getting a better material life became a goal for them, they cannot afford the condition if their life get corrupted. Vice versa, some people wandering why we live this world, we have to fight and get the thing we do not have. Otherwise, why we live in that world, competition is annoying but interesting. Having a goal is the great for everyone, the reason for us to live in the world is that we need to enjoy everything we encountered, no matter good and bad, but we cannot be too extreme, and we cannot loose what human should have which is passion, being cruel and having vanity cannot make our life wonderful and happy. Isn’t it a kind of silly and immature?</p>
<p>In conclusion, it is not bad that we have vanity for being materialism, everyone cares their self-image, caring their image and dressing style is also a way to respect people, we cannot go out without washing and dressing. And being knowledgeable can efforts self-improvement, but we cannot compare with others. Lastly, having fortune and solid social status can assist us to achieve something, but we cannot being materialism and greedy. Having a better life and make the world full of love, it is not only shown on how expensive the purse people wear, simple is the best way to live and enjoy. So being materialism make people’s life boring and cruel, something we cares too much may not the thing that other people cares, such as clothes, cars, and bags. Being Simple and honest could instead of everything.</p>
