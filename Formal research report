<p>Technology in Hospitality business</p>
<p>In ancient Greece time period, guest rights were an established set of conventions that were accepted amongst the different cultures in the Greek world. In ancient Rome, roman businessmen travelled they were some of the first known to travel for pleasure. In the middle ages, others provided safety, shelter and food to travelers. However, travel became more and more popular, people treat hotel like their own private home and club. People found that they can also bring food and do something fun in the place where they taking the rest, hence hospitality became a hot trend [1]. What related with hospitality industry, such as hotel, restaurant, casinos and travel agency. Every firms of hospitality industry have their own technology, such as hotel are running a system by keeping every guests, restaurant have the mobile system to keep guest enjoy the stay, casino have the stronger technology by letting customer happy even they lose money, travel agency have much more complete system to manage because they have to balance which hotel or restaurants are good and have the best price for them to earn money, the system is gathering all information from everywhere on the website. So the comment on the travel agency is pretty important for running a good company.</p>
<p>In this days and ages, people like to contact each other by social network, hospitality field is no exception. New technologies software updated frequently by the prosperity and development of the hospitality industry, lodging and food and beverage are two main parts in this field. Some people invented high technological system because people chase quick and convenient life pace. Thus integration, personalized, mobility, social network and social media systems are extremely virtual for operating a good business. More explanations are behind this.</p>
<p>Speaking on technology, some new science technology may come to your mind firstly. The technology in Hospitality industry is different, it is a kind of system which can help boost the company economy and make people do thing easy and better. It is something we invented and updated all the time, so that people can win from the competitors in the same field of industry, before we talk about the technology, we need to give a brief information about hospitality history, and show that how people like hospitality and what made them change that much, Is it good or bad?</p>
<p>Base on my research, the history of the hospitality industry is interesting, the first building for hotel which built in America in 1794 located in New York City. They offered shampoo is in New York City, they have butler to send luggage to the guest room, maybe it is already old or renewed to see right now, but it was the best one at that time. In the original system, hospitality industry take notes on paper, they made reservation on paper, and everything in the hotel which related with technology are light and phone. Nowadays, everything changed, all facilities that guest use cannot leave without technology, for instance, automatic curtain, television and electronic toilet, Of course, the most important thing are the electronic computer system for front desk and service center [2].</p>
<p>Integration means that collecting all information and customers’ spending histories in the system so that each department of hotel could view and offer the most appropriate services. Take a world famous luxury resort and casino Wynn as an example, they earn the AAA five diamond, Mobil five-star, Forbes five-star and Michelin five -star hotel[3]. They are running a full system hotel, there are so many different firms of restaurant, sports club and spa center. If guest come to purchase service and product with forgetting the purse, they can put the bill to their final account with telling them the room number, and employee can also offer some advices base on their personal information. In another case, every guests enjoy being remember the name by employees because it could make them feel important, so it will gain the impression by calling their name. For future plan, some customer may is a membership of the hotel company, there may have some extra services which could please them and dig their potential purchase loyalty. Hence, this system can help company make final report and communicate with customers. Just like it mentioned by article” Six technology trends revolutionizing the hospitality industry” “On a wider scale, there are developments towards a complete open industry approach, connecting central reservations systems via the HTNG open interface standard, whilst other CRM applications can be linked via flexible web services integration with open API's that are compliant with industry standards.”[4] </p>
<p>Take a hotel chain, St. Regis in Singapore is the case, they provide 299 elegantly decoration guest rooms, customize fiber and lush fabric. Catering places that they have are the finest and elegance. No matter which departments of the hotel, they all keep in one system, so it is extreme easy to find out guest stay history. The most special service they have is the Butler service, their service is unique, and the service they offer are based on the need for guests, they may be prepared well before you arrival, and they could promise the fresh grad, flawless personalized attention for the service they offered. For instance, butler will address your family name with respect when you call them, and butler is the one who focus on serving you and know you well. For helping your stay, they may also put the appropriate magazine in the room by knowing your visit propose and your career. Those care are tiny details, but they will win if they can remember those details in the system, know the guest’s habit and how to take care the return customer, people will come visit more and they will be your loyalty customer forever [5].</p>
<p>Capturing what guest need is pretty important for service industry. Specific reference will be ask when we having the reservation online or by phone, such as floor choices, Smoking or Non-smoking room, early check-in or check-out time. As an up-scale hotel, they need to take care their customer personalize requirement, and offer the highest quality of services. No matter on personal training or room flower, so create a system which can keep valuable customer preference data can help hotel and customer both way, and win return visit will be help hotel develop the future career.</p>
<p>Every customer are important for the property, the only thing that company need to do is to remember each guest name and be sure they are on the system, give some kinds of rewards and cares by mails and phones, that will please guest in a huge extent.[6]</p>
<p>Mobility became more and more popular, because it is convenient and fun to order food and service through those electronic devices and interesting software. Base on the City Nite survey report, we can see obviously that the industry already eliminate the old-fashioned, manual registration desk processes. Using those high technique devices could make employees more flexible by meeting the customer out of the office and help them do early check-in in anywhere. Talk these from economic standpoint, the reason why it is popular is that the cost of using these electronic devices is not so high, hotel not have to buy phone for customer and customer like to save the app on their iPhone, and it take so many benefits for the hotel and enhance the work efficiency [7].</p>
<p>Some restaurants and hotels made a theme which is temporary style, people live in this temporary society, and they like to heritage the advanced facility, such as Ipad and self-serve machine, even some elder people, they are also learning how to use it. Entrepreneur focus on develop this kind of order machine because they found that is the mainstream, if the restaurant order menu by Ipad, so young people just came because they heard from others, that does not matter with whether do they have it or not. Because of this, the software which people invent for app became popular. Employee can place or cancel the order without running to the kitchen.</p>
<p>Thinking the issue in customer perception, mobile just instead of PC, IPAD or some big electronic devices. By satisfying the customer and make a better business, some companies are investing get the app software, so that customer can read the menu and make reservation via phone. It is a fact that people did a survey about restaurant and hotel, over 50% percent restaurants have mobile website, 25% have mobile app. To make a prediction to 2015, more and more restaurants are having the mobile website(85%) and mobile app(70%).For hotels, 76 percentage of hotels have mobile website and 40 percentage of them have mobile app, by 2015, 91% of them are having mobile website and 75 percentage are having mobile app. People must wondering why they download this software, because it can convenient to people’s life, in future year, and people use it to make the reservation, place the order and gather the feedback [8].</p>
<p>Why people want to invent the mobile strategy? Dr. Kasavana from Michigan State University said that ‘It is not convinced of the potential benefits resulting in enhanced guest engagement, improved customer satisfaction, and increased consumer spending. The common goals of mobile technology implementation are acceleration of guest traffic, heightened interactivity, promotion and sales of goods and services, and gathering of feedback relative to the guest’s experience.” Mobile service include special website configuration, fluent marketing campaigns, location based activity, digital coupon and point-of-scale settlement. Mobile payment and order by mobile machine are popular. Because of this, the mobile devices market is getting wider [9].There are some other function about mobile devices which used into the hospitality industry, tracking the location is pretty useful for people who do delivery, it is a kind of sweet that letting customer know the process, Domino’s invented the fun and cute image for customer to track.</p>
<p>Talking on the effects that social media made for the industry, it made a dominant function for one individual company. The reputation of the business are all rely on the comment which people made online and advertisements. Social network is the most popular thing to do in the free time to chat and communicate, people can find customer through social network because it able to check message and status 24 hours. People feel proud by adding customers as their friends, loyalty customer and build steady friendship, guests number increase rely on social network, people put comments and grades for the restaurant and hotel where they went. And company will uploaded coupon onscreen barcode on Facebook or Twitter, some company get more opportunities for getting more customers through various ways. “Sundrop also captures social media identity for additional promotion opportunity to guests’ friends, taking advantage of the prompt attention and higher redemption rates currently associated with text messages, just like says Lee Harville, VP, channel sales for Sundrop [10]. </p>
<p>Social media are web-based and cloud based technologies established by concern from the competitors and guests. Ten people will remember company if company do one thing bad and people can know it by the word of mouth, rapid spread of communication became a vital impact tool for one company. Here are the advantages of social media “(a) reaching global audience, even in remote corners of the world; (b) immediacy with no time lag; (c) easy accessibility by those receiving the communication as long as they can get their hands on a computer keyboard; (d) twenty four hours, seven day operations thereby overcoming the time difference; and (e) ubiquitous versatility for interactive exchanges.” Well management of social media could help explore the marketing and manage the hotel or restaurant. Some company focus on showing their core valuable and get benefit form cohesive strategy plan, it make people have willingness to pay more money for the brand company[11].</p>
<p>In one city, there are various restaurants for people to go, some are really welcome by the people and some are not. What made them different is even both restaurant taste good, that is because social media, people like to follow the mainstream, and they to try the one said by others mouth, words by mouth is the second social media, some people tried fresh and the some people who chase the popular thing keeping visiting the restaurant. In the article” Social media’s influence on Hospitality & Tourism Management, author listed so many ways to use the benefit for social media “(1) solicit endorsements; (2) maximize revenue per seat; (3) bond with guests; (4) manage reputation; (5) reach out to new customers; (6) recruit new staff; and (7) build a buzz.”
The score which posted by the customer on the social network, such as Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin, Trip advisor and yelp.com. We have to allow bad comments occur while manage these website, both positive and negative comments should be posted on the website [12], it can make people feel they live in the true life and some people do not go because the restaurant is not the type they want.

<p>In conclusion, technology can change an industry tremendously by the times, there always have some reasons base on visiting rate. Social media, Social network integration and personalized service are key aspect for enhance. Social Media have a strong power for the hospitality industry, they decide whether it is good or bad, comments are important except advertisement, word by mouth is the key way to promote. Some new industry who just come to this field can make some kinds of promotion strategy, such as investing the discount card on the social network, at the original way, people would just print it out and bring to the restaurant, but now people just take copy of the discount screen barcode and save it in the phone. After they try the new restaurant, hotel or tourism, people could choose how much they like by using the mobile device, and give the feedback. From the feedback, company will know that how they integrate their guest and how personalized they served.</p>
<p>Look back for the hospitality industry, hotel and restaurant had developed so many, every company had changed, especially for the world famous hotel property, they offer the meticulously care for guests, why they have these expenses to the system, but not others, owner may make loan or borrow money from others, but they paid for this system and they can win more than the system. However, those technology can effect it in positive way and negative way both, the important thing is that we need to find out what is the problem and use new technology system to fix it, and make new technology be a virtual role and invent as more as possible by convenient guests.</p>
