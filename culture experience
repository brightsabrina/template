		<p>Hello! Everyone, my name is Shuang Xing, I am an international student, and this is my third year in Michigan State University. I am sophomore, the reason why I am sophomore in my third year in Michigan State University campus life. And the reason is that I spend a year to be trained in advanced English before I take academic class. During that year, I was so exciting to take my major class which is Hospitality Business, I have so much passion about this field. In the next paragraphs, I will introduce more about my major and my career path.</p>
<p>Hospitality Business is a kind of service business, its include lodging, restaurant, event planning, cruise line, casino and so on. In my personal opinion, it is an industry which can occur in the world forever because it is related with tourism. People pay the money for fun while travelling, they eat outside and find entertainment outside, and we are the people who offer them perfect accommodations and wonderful services. In addition, this is not the only reason that I want to study Hospitality Business, but I also have a lot of passion about this major, I feel so pleased when I see people are satisfied with my service and warm care. To enrich my life and do more practices in my study life, I participated several activities and events, such as I became an ambassador of Career Expo, a server for the Les Gourmet and attending the National restaurant show (NRA) in Chicago and so forth. Speaking more about the NRA show, I think this is the most interesting event that I have attended in Hospitality study tour, it was held by worldwide peers in this domain, and people came to attend this show from the whole world. And it has variable fields about Hospitality business, people who produce the container, cup, furniture, food and education service came to this event, it really broadened my vision. Some of them were taking the responsibility to extend their business. Except that, we also met some alumni from The School of Hospitality Business in Michigan State University, some of them did a great contribution for The School and Hospitality business industry. For instance, people such as the inventor of Disney internship program and some general managers from Chicago hotel, owners of restaurant and private club. Knowing the people who from the same school is important, and find the way about how to make more friends who has same dream with us is also a good opportunity for us to learn something. So we participated some kinds of social activity, we represented The school to meet some friends from other school or students from other country, that experience let me know some basic social skills and made some friends who share same kinds of dream with me, it made me feel like I am involved in a big group and family, we exchange the idea about courses we can take, the places where we can get further study for this field, the better ideas and places to find internships. Therefore, the social circle may has been created.</p>
<p>My dream is became an owner of a branch hotel and theme restaurant, such as being a part of member of Starwood or some high exotic luxury restaurant.</p>
<p>What made me have so many passion about hospitality field, the reason is that I was effected by visiting some famous hotels through travelling with my family and my dad, I was interested in the decoration style they have in each hotel is unique, the service they offer are comprehensive and the atmosphere they create imparted an air of elegance, everything I saw are soaked in my mind. By the time, I am grown up and I have chance to learn what I like, so that is the reason why hotel management attract me.
For archiving my dream, there is no doubt that fund support and management skills are needed, those experience must be get on my own, nobody can take my place to do it. In my experience, I understand that we have to do the job from the basic level to management level, so now I have already started my level 1 job which is a waitress in a restaurant. I am keen on doing this job, because I am so enjoy to serve people and it is a kind professional job for me, vice versa, some body think being a server is tired, dirty and it is the basic level of all jobs, but I do not think so. Because accumulating my experience is extremely important, I cannot stop because there are so many different kinds of job wait me to do, and there is a strong competition in this field and society nowadays. So learning something through the real life is the thing that I can absorb. However, theory is also needed, in other words, we have to think while we doing the job, such as Hospitality finance and Marketing, and thinking about why we have to do things follow the rules, there always have the reason, maybe we cannot understand and realize that time, we will know it when something happened in the future.
</p>
<p>People have to improve themselves while the world developing. As a student, I will not experience that right now, but every time I go travel to the big city, I can hardly catch the pace of the local citizens’ life, in my sight, they are walking fast, they eating fast, driving fast and doing everything fast and effective. Last summer, I went to Singapore with my dad, we were doing something about business, the local cooperator use mini-pad take note and search the solutions when we need some information all the time, they can draw, type and manage the account. However, people has no those kinds of technologies to help them work more efficiently, for example, people need to write letter and use note books to record everything, if they have question, they have to go somewhere directly, but now we can just stay one place do all the things by phone or online, all data we have could be store in one electronic device. In summary, I found that we have to catch every opportunity to finish every business in the shortest time with high efficiency. Internet and electronic device make people’s life convenient and develop fast. As a people in fast pace, we need to use it to get efficiency and helpful methods, in go chasing the dream. </p>
<p>In conclusion, I think the major of Hospitality Business will have a bright future and it will become a huge industry. And due to my passion in the area, I will try my best to contribute in this charming field. As long as I keep constantly cultivate myself in literary and social skills, and managing capacity, and I will temper myself in practical works so as to improve and enrich myself. At the end, I will finally success. Also I hope and believe that Hospitality Business is going to become more and more popular, and it will developed with those high technology and modern society.</p>
